This weekâ€™s assignment involves developing a simple ANN with 1 layer, forward propagation, backward propagation, activation and loss function for a simple predication use case. A data frame is created as sample dataset to resemble credit default predication task which was proposed as my final project. Then user is asked to input applicant data and ANN returns prediction. 
Flow illustrated as follows. 
Forward Propagation:
Input -> Weight & Bias -> Activation -> Hidden Output -> Output Activation -> Prediction  
Backpropagation:
Loss -> Gradient for weights & bias (output layer) -> Gradient for Weights & Bias (Hidden Layer) -> Update Weights 
 This assignment is a good refresher of the basic concepts of ANN and its structure.
